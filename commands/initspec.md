name: initspec
description: Initialize the Apex Spec System in the current project
---

# /initspec Command

Set up the complete `.spec_system/` directory structure and initial files for a new or existing project.

## Rules

1. **Never overwrite existing `.spec_system/state.json`** without explicit user confirmation
2. **ASCII-only characters** (0-127) in all generated files
3. **Unix LF line endings** only
4. **Minimal structure** - don't over-engineer the initial setup

## Steps

### 1. Check Current State

First, check if the spec system is already initialized:
- Look for `.spec_system/state.json`
- Check for `.spec_system/PRD/` directory
- Check for `.spec_system/specs/` directory

If already initialized, ask the user if they want to reinitialize (this will reset state).

### 2. Gather Project Information

Ask the user for:
- **Project name**: Name of the project
- **Project description**: Brief description of what the project does
- **First phase name**: Name for Phase 00 (default: "Foundation")

### 3. Create Directory Structure

Create the following directories:

```bash
mkdir -p .spec_system/PRD/phase_00
mkdir -p .spec_system/specs
mkdir -p .spec_system/audit
mkdir -p .spec_system/archive/backups
mkdir -p .spec_system/archive/sessions
mkdir -p .spec_system/archive/planning
mkdir -p .spec_system/archive/PRD
mkdir -p .spec_system/archive/phases
```

### 3a. Brownfield Monorepo Detection

Detect whether the project is a monorepo. **Skip this step entirely for greenfield (empty) projects** -- leave `monorepo: null` in state.json.

For brownfield projects (existing code present):

1. Source common.sh and call `detect_monorepo()` to check for workspace config files (pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, nx.json, package.json workspaces, Cargo.toml workspace, go.work, lerna.json)

2. If `detect_monorepo()` returns `detected: true`:
   - Display the detected indicator and discovered packages to the user
   - Ask the user to **confirm**, **edit** (add/remove packages), or **skip** (leave as null)
   - **Confirmed**: Set `monorepo: true` and store the packages array in state.json (Step 4)
   - **Edited**: Set `monorepo: true` with user-adjusted packages array
   - **Skipped**: Leave `monorepo: null` -- can be resolved later by `/createprd`

3. If `detect_monorepo()` returns `detected: false`:
   - Leave `monorepo: null` (do NOT set to false here -- `/createprd` may detect monorepo intent from PRD content)

**Important**: Never set `monorepo: false` during initspec. Only `null` (unknown) or `true` (confirmed). The `/createprd` command handles the `false` determination.

### 4. Create state.json

Create `.spec_system/state.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "project_name": "[PROJECT_NAME]",
  "description": "[PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]",
  "current_phase": 0,
  "current_session": null,
  "monorepo": null,
  "phases": {
    "0": {
      "name": "[PHASE_NAME]",
      "status": "not_started",
      "session_count": 0
    }
  },
  "completed_sessions": [],
  "next_session_history": []
}
```

**If monorepo confirmed in Step 3a**, set `"monorepo": true` and add the packages array:

```json
{
  "monorepo": true,
  "packages": [
    {"name": "web", "path": "apps/web", "stack_hint": "TypeScript"},
    {"name": "api", "path": "apps/api", "stack_hint": "TypeScript"}
  ]
}
```

Otherwise, `"monorepo": null` and no `packages` field.

### 5. Create PRD Template

Create `.spec_system/PRD/PRD.md` with a starter template:

```markdown
# [PROJECT_NAME] - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

[PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]

## Goals

1. [Goal 1]
2. [Goal 2]
3. [Goal 3]

## Phases

1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]

### Sessions (To Be Defined)

Use `/plansession` to get recommendations for sessions to implement.

## Technical Stack

- [Technology 1]
- [Technology 2]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
```

### 6. Create CONSIDERATIONS.md

Create `.spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md` (institutional memory for AI assistants):

```markdown

```

### 7. Create SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md

Create `.spec_system/SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md` (cumulative security posture and GDPR compliance record):

```markdown
# Security & Compliance

> Cumulative security posture and GDPR compliance record. Updated between phases via /carryforward.
> **Line budget**: 1000 max | **Last updated**: Phase 00 (YYYY-MM-DD)

```

### 8. Create CONVENTIONS.md

Create `.spec_system/CONVENTIONS.md` (coding standards and team conventions):

```markdown
# CONVENTIONS.md

## Guiding Principles

- Optimize for readability over cleverness
- Code is written once, read many times
- Consistency beats personal preference
- If it can be automated, automate it
- When writing code: Make NO assumptions. Do not be lazy.  Pattern match precisely.  Do not skim when you need detailed info from documents. Validate systematically.

## Naming

- Be descriptive over concise: `getUserById` > `getUser` > `fetch`
- Booleans read as questions: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `shouldRetry`
- Functions describe actions: `calculateTotal`, `validateInput`, `sendNotification`
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood (`id`, `url`, `config` are fine)
- Match domain language--use the same terms as product/design/stakeholders

## Files & Structure

- One concept per file where practical
- File names reflect their primary export or purpose
- Group by feature/domain, not by type (prefer `/orders/api.ts` over `/api/orders.ts`)
- Keep nesting shallow--if you're 4+ levels deep, reconsider

## Functions & Modules

- Functions do one thing
- If a function needs a comment explaining what it does, consider renaming it
- Keep functions short enough to read without scrolling
- Avoid side effects where possible; be explicit when they exist

## Comments

- Explain *why*, not *what*
- Delete commented-out code--that's what git is for
- TODOs include context: `// TODO(name): reason, ticket if applicable`
- Update or remove comments when code changes

## Error Handling

- Fail fast and loud in development
- Fail gracefully in production
- Errors should be actionable--include context for debugging
- Don't swallow errors silently

## Database Layer

### Connection
- Connection string source: [env var name -- never hardcoded]
- Pool size: [N]
- Separate connection URLs for: app, migrations, tests

### Migrations
- Tool: [detected]
- Location: [path]
- Naming convention: [pattern]
- CRITICAL: Never modify a migration already applied to shared environments
- Every migration must have a reverse/down

### Models / Schema
- Location: [path]
- Naming: [convention for models and tables]
- Required columns: [timestamps, soft delete, etc.]

### Queries
- Parameterized only (no string concatenation)
- N+1 prevention strategy: [chosen approach]
- Transaction boundary rules: [when to wrap]

### Seeding
- Script: [path]
- Must be idempotent (safe to re-run)

### Testing
- Strategy: [separate DB / transaction rollback / in-memory]
- Fixture location: [path]

### Vector / Embeddings (if applicable)
- Store: [pgvector extension / standalone service]
- Embedding model: [model name + dimensions]
- Index type: [HNSW / IVFFlat / etc.]
- Distance metric: [cosine / L2 / inner product]

## Testing

- Test behavior, not implementation
- A test's name should describe the scenario and expectation
- If it's hard to test, the design might need rethinking
- Flaky tests get fixed or deleted--never ignored

## Git & Version Control

- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise (`Add user validation` not `Added some validation stuff`)
- One logical change per commit
- Branch names: `type/short-description` (e.g., `feat/user-auth`, `fix/cart-total`)
- Keep commits atomic enough to revert safely

## Pull Requests

- Small PRs get better reviews
- Description explains the *what* and *why*--reviewers can see the *how*
- Link relevant tickets/context
- Review your own PR before requesting others

## Code Review

- Critique code, not people
- Ask questions rather than make demands
- Approve when it's good enough, not perfect
- Nitpicks are labeled as such

## Dependencies

- Fewer dependencies = less risk
- Justify additions; prefer well-maintained, focused libraries
- Pin versions; update intentionally

## Local Dev Tools

| Category | Tool | Config |
|----------|------|--------|
| Formatter | not configured | - |
| Linter | not configured | - |
| Type Safety | not configured | - |
| Testing | not configured | - |
| Observability | not configured | - |
| Git Hooks | not configured | - |
| Database | not configured | - |

**Conditional**: The "Database Layer" section above is only included when DB signals are detected during brownfield `/initspec` (docker-compose with DB service, `.env` with `DATABASE_URL`, migration tool config files present). For greenfield projects, this section is deferred to `/createprd`.

## When In Doubt

- Ask
- Leave it better than you found it
- Ship, learn, iterate
```

**If monorepo confirmed in Step 3a**, append a Workspace Structure section to CONVENTIONS.md:

```markdown
## Workspace Structure

| Package | Path | Stack |
|---------|------|-------|
| [name] | [path] | [stack_hint] |

### Cross-Package Rules

- Import from sibling packages via workspace aliases, not relative paths
- Shared types live in a dedicated shared/common package
- Each package owns its own tests; integration tests live at repo root
- Changes spanning multiple packages require explicit cross-package session scope

### Database Ownership
| Database | Owner Package | Type | Shared By |
| [name] | [package path] | [type] | [consumers] |

- Migrations live in the owner package
- Consuming packages use the owner's API, not direct DB access
```

### 9. Create Phase PRD

Create `.spec_system/PRD/phase_00/PRD_phase_00.md`:

```markdown
# Phase 00: [PHASE_NAME]

**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: 0/0 sessions (0%)

## Overview

[Phase description - to be filled in]

## Progress Tracker

| Session | Name | Status | Validated |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| - | No sessions defined | - | - |

## Next Steps

Run `/plansession` to get the first session recommendation.
```

### 10. Copy Scripts Locally (Optional)

Ask user: "Copy scripts locally for customization, or use plugin scripts (recommended)?"

- **Plugin** (default): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/` - auto-updates with plugin
- **Local**: `.spec_system/scripts/` - per-project customization, won't auto-update

If user wants local scripts:

```bash
mkdir -p .spec_system/scripts
cp ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/*.sh .spec_system/scripts/
chmod +x .spec_system/scripts/*.sh
```

### 11. Report Success

Tell the user:

```
Apex Spec System initialized!

Created:
- .spec_system/state.json (project state tracking)
- .spec_system/PRD/PRD.md (product requirements document)
- .spec_system/PRD/phase_00/PRD_phase_00.md (phase tracker)
- .spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md (institutional memory for AI)
- .spec_system/SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md (security posture & GDPR compliance)
- .spec_system/CONVENTIONS.md (coding standards and team conventions)
- .spec_system/specs/ (session specifications directory)
- .spec_system/audit/ (audit reports directory)
- .spec_system/archive/ (completed work archive)

[If monorepo detected and confirmed:]
Monorepo: Detected via [indicator] with N packages
[If monorepo not detected:]
Monorepo: Not detected (can be set later via /createprd)

Next Steps:
1. Edit .spec_system/PRD/PRD.md with your project requirements
2. Customize .spec_system/CONVENTIONS.md with your project's coding standards (optional but recommended)
3. Run /phasebuild to define sessions for Phase 00 (recommended for new projects)
   OR run /plansession directly if you already know your first session
4. Follow the workflow: /plansession -> /implement -> /validate -> /updateprd
5. Repeat step 4 until all sessions in the phase are complete
6. Run /carryforward (optional) to capture lessons learned, then /phasebuild for next phase
```
