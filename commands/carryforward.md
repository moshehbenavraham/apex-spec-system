# /carryforward Command

Extract key insights from the just-completed phase and update `.spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md` - the institutional memory for AI assistants working on future phases. Be ruthlessly selective: only the most impactful lessons deserve space.

Run after completing a phase, before `/phasebuild`. Optional but recommended for phases with significant discoveries, novel problems, or 4+ sessions.

## Rules

1. **600-line limit STRICT** - trim older/less relevant items if needed
2. **Active Concerns**: max 20 items total (5 per subcategory)
3. **Lessons Learned**: max 30 items total
4. **Resolved**: max 15 items, rotate out after 2 phases
5. **Conciseness**: each item 1-3 lines max, include phase number `[PNN]`
6. **ASCII-only characters** and Unix LF line endings

## Steps

### 1. Verify Phase Completion

Check `.spec_system/state.json`:
- Confirm current phase status is "complete"
- Get phase number and name
- If phase not complete, inform user and exit

### 2. Gather Phase Artifacts

Read all implementation summaries from the completed phase:

```bash
# Find all IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md files for completed phase
ls .spec_system/archive/phases/phase_NN_*/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
```

Also review:
- `.spec_system/audit/` - recent audit reports
- `.spec_system/PRD/phase_NN/` - phase requirements (before archive)
- Any `implementation-notes.md` files with blockers or discoveries

### 3. Extract Insights

From each session's IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, identify:

**Active Concerns** (things that affect upcoming work):
- Unresolved technical debt
- Known limitations or constraints
- External dependencies with risks
- Performance thresholds to monitor
- Security considerations

**Lessons Learned** (patterns to follow or avoid):
- Technical decisions that worked well (and why)
- Approaches that failed (and why)
- Useful patterns discovered
- Tool/library insights
- Architecture insights

**Items to Resolve** (move from Active Concerns if addressed):
- Check if previous Active Concerns were addressed this phase
- Move them to Resolved with brief resolution note

### 4. Read Current CONSIDERATIONS.md

Read `.spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md`:
- Parse existing sections
- Note current line count
- Identify stale items in each section

### 5. Update Document

Update `.spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md` following the format below. Add new items, remove resolved ones, merge similar entries, and enforce the limits in Rules above.

### 6. Report Summary

Tell the user what was updated.

## CONSIDERATIONS.md Format

```markdown
# Considerations

> Institutional memory for AI assistants. Updated between phases via /carryforward.
> **Line budget**: 600 max | **Last updated**: Phase NN (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Active Concerns

Items requiring attention in upcoming phases. Review before each session.

### Technical Debt
<!-- Max 5 items -->

- [P05] **Item name**: Brief description of the concern and why it matters.

### External Dependencies
<!-- Max 5 items -->

- [P08] **Item name**: Brief description of risk or constraint.

### Performance / Security
<!-- Max 5 items -->

- [P11] **Item name**: Threshold or requirement to monitor.

### Architecture
<!-- Max 5 items -->

- [P03] **Item name**: Constraint or consideration for design decisions.

---

## Lessons Learned

Proven patterns and anti-patterns. Reference during implementation.

### What Worked
<!-- Max 15 items -->

- [P02] **Pattern name**: What it is and when to use it.

### What to Avoid
<!-- Max 10 items -->

- [P04] **Anti-pattern name**: What went wrong and why to avoid.

### Tool/Library Notes
<!-- Max 5 items -->

- [P07] **Tool name**: Key insight about usage or configuration.

---

## Resolved

Recently closed items (buffer - rotates out after 2 phases).

| Phase | Item | Resolution |
|-------|------|------------|
| P10 | Item name | How it was resolved |
| P09 | Item name | How it was resolved |

## Line Budget Guidance

Target allocation within 600 lines:
- Header/metadata: ~15 lines
- Active Concerns: ~150 lines (20 items x ~7 lines avg)
- Lessons Learned: ~250 lines (30 items x ~8 lines avg)
- Resolved: ~100 lines (15 items in table)
- Section headers/spacing: ~85 lines

## Trimming Strategy

When approaching 600 lines, trim in this order:
1. Resolved items older than 2 phases
2. Lessons Learned items older than 5 phases (unless still highly relevant)
3. Active Concerns that have become irrelevant
4. Merge similar items within sections
5. Shorten verbose descriptions

## Output

```
Phase NN Carryforward Complete

Updated .spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md:
- Active Concerns: +N new, -N resolved, N total
- Lessons Learned: +N new, N total
- Resolved: +N added, -N rotated out, N total
- Line count: NNN/600

Key additions:
- [Active] Brief description
- [Lesson] Brief description

Ready for /documents to maintain project documentation.
