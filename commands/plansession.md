description: Analyze project state, create session spec and task checklist
---

# /plansession Command

Analyze project state, recommend the next session, create its specification, and generate the task checklist -- all in one step.

## Rules

1. **Script first** - Always run `analyze-project.sh --json` before any analysis
2. **Trust the script** - Use JSON output as authoritative state; do not parse `state.json` directly
3. **One session at a time** - Only recommend one session
4. **Respect dependencies** - Don't skip prerequisites
5. **MVP focus** - Recommend core features before polish
6. **Scope discipline** - Sessions must be 12-25 tasks, 2-4 hours
7. **Hard limits**: max 25 tasks, max 4 hours, single clear objective
8. **Do not invent scope** - derive everything from PRD and session stub
9. **Incorporate CONVENTIONS.md** - naming, file structure, and testing philosophy must be reflected in the spec
10. **Incorporate CONSIDERATIONS.md** - address relevant active concerns and lessons learned
11. **ASCII-only characters** and Unix LF line endings in all output
12. **Task sizing**: ~20-25 minutes each, single file focus when possible, clear atomic action
13. **Every task must have**: task ID (`TNNN`), session ref (`[SPPSS]`), action verb, target file path
14. **Mark `[P]`** when tasks create independent files with no interdependency
15. **Sequence by**: dependencies first, then setup -> foundation -> implementation -> testing
16. **Behavioral quality by design** - When a Behavioral Quality Checklist (BQC) applies to the session's stack, embed edge-case handling into task descriptions. "Create delete dialog" becomes "Create delete dialog (with typed confirmation, disable-while-pending, state reset on close)". Explicit requirements get implemented; implicit ones get skipped.

## Steps

### 1. Get Deterministic Project State (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

Run the analysis script to get reliable state facts. Local scripts (`.spec_system/scripts/`) take precedence over plugin scripts if they exist:

```bash
# Check for local scripts first, fall back to plugin
if [ -d ".spec_system/scripts" ]; then
  bash .spec_system/scripts/analyze-project.sh --json
else
  bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/analyze-project.sh --json
fi
```

This returns structured JSON with:
- `current_phase` - Current phase number
- `current_session` - Active session (or null)
- `completed_sessions` - List of completed session IDs
- `candidate_sessions` - Sessions in current phase with completion status; each candidate includes a `package` field (parsed from stub `Package:` annotation, or null)
- `phases` - All phases with status and session counts
- `monorepo` - true/false/null from state.json
- `packages` - Array of registered packages (empty if not monorepo)
- `active_package` - Resolved package context from `--package` flag or CWD (null if not applicable)
- `monorepo_detection` - Auto-detection result when monorepo is null (null otherwise)

**IMPORTANT**: Use this JSON output as ground truth for all state facts. Do not re-read state.json directly - the script provides authoritative state data.

### 1a. Determine Package Context (Monorepo Only)

**Skip this step if** `monorepo` is not `true` in the JSON output.

When working in a monorepo, resolve the active package for this session. Priority order:

1. **User statement**: If the user explicitly names a package (e.g., "plan a session for apps/web"), use that
2. **Stub annotation**: If the selected candidate has a `package` field from its stub, use that
3. **active_package from script**: If `analyze-project.sh` resolved a package via `--package` flag or CWD inference, use that
4. **Prompt user**: If none of the above resolves a package, ask the user which package this session targets (or whether it is cross-cutting)

Store the resolved package path for use in Steps 4 and 5.

### 2. Read PRD Content for Semantic Analysis

With the state facts established, read these files for context:
- `.spec_system/PRD/PRD.md` - Master project requirements
- `.spec_system/PRD/PRD_UX.md` - UX requirements (if exists -- use for UI-focused sessions)
- Candidate session files from the JSON output (use the `path` field)
- `.spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md` - Institutional memory (if exists)
- `.spec_system/SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md` - Security posture and GDPR compliance (if exists)
- `.spec_system/CONVENTIONS.md` - Project coding conventions (if exists)

Focus on understanding:
- Session objectives and scope
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Logical ordering
- **Active Concerns** that may influence session priority or approach
- **Lessons Learned** relevant to candidate sessions
- **Open security findings** that may affect session scope or approach
- Naming, file placement, and testing approach from CONVENTIONS.md
- If CONVENTIONS.md has a "Database Layer" section and the session involves data layer work (new tables, schema changes, migrations), ensure task planning includes migration, seed update, and DB integration test tasks

### 3. Analyze and Recommend

Using the deterministic state + semantic understanding:

**Determine:**
- Which candidates have unmet prerequisites (based on `completed_sessions`)
- Natural next session based on dependencies
- Complexity and scope assessment

**Evaluate each candidate by:**
- Prerequisites met (check against `completed_sessions` array)
- Dependencies completed
- Logical flow in project progression

If multiple sessions ready: Choose based on dependencies, complexity, project flow.
If session blocked: Recommend alternative with explanation.
If phase complete: Suggest `/phasebuild` for next phase.

### 4. Create Session Directory and Specification

Create the session directory and generate `spec.md`:

```
.spec_system/specs/phaseNN-sessionNN-name/
|-- spec.md
\-- (tasks.md created in next step)
```

Generate `spec.md` with all sections filled in:

```markdown
# Session Specification

**Session ID**: `phaseNN-sessionNN-name`
**Phase**: NN - Phase Name
**Status**: Not Started
**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
[MONOREPO ONLY - include these lines when monorepo: true]
**Package**: [package-path]
**Package Stack**: [stack]
[END MONOREPO ONLY - omit both lines for single-repo projects]

### 4a. Enrich Task Descriptions with BQC (Stack-Conditional)

**Skip if** the session's stack does not match any defined BQC (see `/implement` Step 3a for stack detection).

When a BQC applies, enrich task descriptions in Step 5 using this table:

| If task involves... | Append to description... |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| useEffect / side effects | "with cleanup return for [timers/listeners/controllers]" |
| Dialog, modal, drawer, sheet | "with state reset on close" |
| Form submission | "with disable-while-pending and reset on success" |
| Data fetching view | "with loading, empty, and error states" |
| Delete/remove/revoke action | "with confirmation and disable-while-pending" |
| Paginated list | "with bounds-clamped pagination" |
| Optimistic update | "with scoped rollback on error" |
| Custom interactive control | "with keyboard accessibility (Tab/Enter/Space/Escape)" |
| Animation or transition | "with prefers-reduced-motion alternative" |
| API response consumption | "with types matching generated API contract" |
| Mobile/responsive layout | "using dvh/dvw viewport units" |

These add 5-15 words per task but prevent the 10x-cost bugs found in later audits.

### 5. Generate Task Checklist

From the spec, identify deliverables, success criteria, technical approach, testing requirements, and dependencies between tasks. Then create `tasks.md` in the session directory:

```markdown
# Task Checklist

**Session ID**: `phaseNN-sessionNN-name`
**Total Tasks**: [N]
**Estimated Duration**: [X-Y] hours
**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Legend

- `[x]` = Completed
- `[ ]` = Pending
- `[P]` = Parallelizable (can run with other [P] tasks)
- `[SNNMM]` = Session reference (NN=phase number, MM=session number)
- `TNNN` = Task ID

```

### Path Scoping Rules (Monorepo Only)

When `monorepo: true`, apply these path conventions in tasks.md:

- **All file paths must be package-relative from the repo root** (e.g., `apps/web/src/auth.ts`, not `src/auth.ts`)
- **Single-package sessions**: All paths should start with the package path prefix
- **Cross-package sessions**: Group tasks by package using subheadings within each category:

```markdown
## Implementation (N tasks)

### apps/web

- [ ] T006 [SPPSS] Implement auth page (`apps/web/src/pages/auth.tsx`)
- [ ] T007 [SPPSS] Add auth hook (`apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)

### apps/api

- [ ] T008 [SPPSS] Implement auth endpoint (`apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`)
```

For single-repo projects, paths remain unchanged (relative to project root as usual).

## Category Budgets

| Category | Tasks | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Setup | 2-4 | Environment, directories, config |
| Foundation | 4-8 | Core types, interfaces, base classes |
| Implementation | 8-15 | Main feature logic |
| Testing | 3-5 | Tests, validation, verification |

### 6. Update State

Update `.spec_system/state.json`:

```json
{
  "current_session": "phaseNN-sessionNN-name",
  "next_session_history": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "session": "phaseNN-sessionNN-name",
      "status": "planned"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Set `current_session` to the session ID
- Add a single entry to `next_session_history` with status `planned`
- **Monorepo only**: Include an optional `package` field in the history entry when a package was resolved in Step 1a:
  ```json
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "session": "phaseNN-sessionNN-name",
    "package": "apps/web",
    "status": "planned"
  }
  ```
  Omit the `package` field for single-repo projects or cross-cutting sessions.

### 7. Archive Stale Specs

Keep `.spec_system/specs/` lean by archiving old session specs. **Retention rule**: only keep specs from the current phase and one phase back. Move everything older to `.spec_system/archive/sessions/`.

Example: If currently on Phase 3, keep Phase 2 and Phase 3 specs. Archive Phase 0 and Phase 1 specs.

---

## Output

After creating spec.md and tasks.md, summarize to the user:
- Recommended session name and why it's next
- Key deliverables
- Total task count and category breakdown
- Estimated duration
- Key parallelization opportunities

Prompt them to run `/implement` to begin.
