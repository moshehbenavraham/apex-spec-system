# /phasebuild Command

Create the directory structure, phase PRD, and session stubs for a new phase. Ensures alignment with completed work and lessons learned.

## Rules

1. **ASCII-only characters** and Unix LF line endings in all output
2. **Resolve misalignment before building** - as projects progress, later phases may drift from reality. Reconcile with actual progress before creating artifacts.
3. **If interrupted mid-process**, delete partial artifacts before retrying
4. Each session must have a single clear objective, 12-25 tasks, 2-4 hours scope

## Steps

### 1. Assess Current State

Read `.spec_system/state.json` and `.spec_system/PRD/` to understand:
- What has been accomplished
- Next sequential phase number
- High-level objectives remaining

If `.spec_system/CONSIDERATIONS.md` exists, review it for:
- **Active Concerns** that should influence session ordering or scope
- **Lessons Learned** (patterns to follow or avoid)
- **Tool/Library Notes** relevant to this phase

### 2. Create Phase Directory and PRD Markdown

Create directory `.spec_system/PRD/phase_NN/` and markdown `.spec_system/PRD/phase_NN/PRD_phase_NN.md`:

```markdown
# PRD Phase NN: Phase Name

**Status**: Not Started
**Sessions**: N (initial estimate)
**Estimated Duration**: X-Y days

**Progress**: 0/N sessions (0%)

## Overview

[Phase description]

---

## Progress Tracker

| Session | Name | Status | Est. Tasks | Validated |
|---------|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| 01 | [Name] | Not Started | ~12-25 | - |
| 02 | [Name] | Not Started | ~12-25 | - |
| 03 | [Name] | Not Started | ~12-25 | - |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## Completed Sessions

[None yet]

---

## Upcoming Sessions

- Session 01: [Name]

---

## Objectives

1. [Primary objective]
2. [Secondary objective]
3. [Tertiary objective]

---

## Prerequisites

- Phase NN-1 completed (omit for Phase 01)
- [Other prerequisites]

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
[Architecture notes for this phase]

### Technologies
- [Technology 1]
- [Technology 2]

### Risks
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigation]

### Relevant Considerations
<!-- From CONSIDERATIONS.md - remove section if none apply -->
- [P##] **[Item from Active Concerns]**: How it affects this phase
- [P##] **[Lesson Learned]**: How we're applying it

---

## Success Criteria

Phase complete when:
- [ ] All N sessions completed
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]

---

## Dependencies

### Depends On
- Phase NN-1: [Name]

### Enables
- Phase NN+1: [Name]
```

### 3. Create All Session Stubs

For each session, create `session_NN_name.md` (use `snake_case` for name):

.spec_system/PRD/phase_NN/
├── PRD_phase_NN.md
├── session_01_name.md
├── session_02_name.md
└── ...

```markdown
# Session NN: Session Name

**Session ID**: `phaseNN-sessionNN-name`
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Tasks**: ~12-25
**Estimated Duration**: 2-4 hours

---

## Objective

[Clear single objective for this session]

---

## Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

### Out of Scope
- [Deferred item 1]

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] [Prerequisite 1]

---

## Deliverables

1. [Deliverable 1]
2. [Deliverable 2]

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
```

### 4. Update State

Merge into `.spec_system/state.json` (add to existing `phases` object):

```json
{
  "phases": {
    "NN": {
      "name": "Phase Name",
      "description": "Phase description",
      "status": "not_started",
      "session_count": N
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Update Master PRD

Add the new phase to the Phases table in `.spec_system/PRD/PRD.md`. Also update any stale info (completed phases marked as such, session counts reflecting reality):

```markdown
## Phases

| Phase | Name | Sessions | Status |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| NN | Phase Name | N | Not Started |
```

## Phase Planning Guidelines

### Session Count
- Typical phase: 4-8 sessions
- Small phase: 2-3 sessions
- Large phase: Consider splitting

### Session Sizing
- Each session: 12-25 tasks
- Each session: 2-4 hours
- Single clear objective per session

### Dependency Management
- Sessions within phase can depend on each other
- Early sessions provide foundation
- Later sessions build complexity

## Output

Report to user:

```
Phase NN Created: Phase Name

Structure:
- .spec_system/PRD/phase_NN/
  - PRD_phase_NN.md
  - session_01_name.md
  - session_02_name.md
  - session_03_name.md

State Updated:
- Phase added to .spec_system/state.json
- Master PRD updated

Sessions Defined: N

Next Steps:
- Review session definitions
- Adjust scope as needed
- Run `/nextsession` to begin
```
