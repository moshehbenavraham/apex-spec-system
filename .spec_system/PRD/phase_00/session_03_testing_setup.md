# Session 03: Testing Setup

**Session ID**: `phase00-session03-testing-setup`
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Tasks**: ~15
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours

## Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- Test framework configuration
- Test directory structure
- Test utilities and helpers
- Sample/example tests
- Test running scripts
- Basic CI configuration (optional)

### Out of Scope
- End-to-end testing (deferred)
- Performance testing (deferred)
- Visual regression testing (deferred)

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Session 01 (Project Setup) completed
- [ ] Session 02 (Core Infrastructure) completed
- [ ] Core application structure in place

---

## Deliverables

1. Test framework configuration
2. Test directory structure
3. Test utilities and fixtures
4. Sample unit tests
5. Test running scripts/commands
6. CI configuration (if applicable)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Test framework installed and configured
- [ ] Tests can be run with single command
- [ ] Sample tests pass
- [ ] Test utilities are reusable
- [ ] Coverage reporting works (optional)
